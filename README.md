PROJECT DESCRIPTION : This project is an AI-powered product recommendation engine built entirely using Python, Flask, and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The goal of this system is to deliver intelligent product suggestions through a RESTful API. The backend is powered by a lightweight Flask server that exposes endpoints to fetch relevant product recommendations based on input. It uses a real dataset containing product names and categories. The machine learning logic is implemented through content-based filtering, which works by analyzing the product’s category metadata to find similar items. Each product’s categories (like “Fashion|Footwear” or “Electronics|Accessories”) are converted into numerical vectors using a technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency). This vectorization allows the system to measure the importance of category keywords across all products. Once vectorized, the system computes similarity scores using cosine similarity — a common technique for comparing vectors — to find the top 5 most similar products to a given input. The similarity scores are precomputed at runtime, and whenever the user queries the API with a product name (even partial), the system attempts to match it against existing products, retrieves the closest match, and returns a list of similar recommendations. The API is designed to be lightweight, clean, and ready for production use or further enhancement. It accepts GET requests at /recommend/<product_name>, and returns recommendations in JSON format. For instance, querying /recommend/shoes might match “Running Shoes” and return a list like “Formal Shoes”, “Sports Watch”, and “Trekking Backpack”. This makes it ideal for integration into e-commerce platforms, shopping apps, or recommendation services that rely on content-based similarity. The project structure is modular and includes separate files for the Flask app (app.py), the machine learning logic (recommender.py), and the dataset (products.csv). There is also a requirements.txt file that specifies dependencies like Flask, pandas, and scikit-learn, making it easy to set up in a virtual environment. One of the strengths of this project is its simplicity and flexibility — it’s small enough to understand quickly but powerful enough to demonstrate real ML functionality. Moreover, the REST API is fully functional and testable via a browser, Postman, or curl. For better usability, the homepage route (/) provides a welcome message and brief usage instructions. Users can input partial or full product names and still receive relevant results due to fuzzy matching. In terms of extensibility, this backend could be expanded to include collaborative filtering, deep learning models, user-based personalization, database support, authentication, or even deployment to cloud platforms like Render, Railway, or Heroku. Additionally, the project is designed to be scalable — other types of recommendation logic (e.g., based on user behavior, purchase history, or item ratings) can be plugged in easily. Overall, this project successfully meets the requirements for building an ML-based recommendation engine backend. It uses proper machine learning techniques (TF-IDF and cosine similarity), provides a Python REST API, processes real structured data, and returns meaningful recommendations. It demonstrates how AI can be integrated into real-world applications like product discovery engines and digital storefronts. The clean codebase, working endpoints, and ability to handle user queries make it a solid foundation for further academic or professional development. This solution is both practical and educational — offering a smart, real-world demonstration of AI in action using simple yet effective machine learning techniques.
